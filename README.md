# Remote-Health-Monitoring-System-using-ESP8266-Arduino-by-sending-data-on-Thingspeak

In this project, the Pulse sensor and the Temperature sensor are interfaced with NodeMCU Esp8266. The data from both of these sensors is sent to the cloud platform Thingspeak. Thingspeak is the open-source IOT platform for storing and retrieving the data without lagging onto the real time data. The connectivity with the IOT platform is done through coding in the Arduino IDE and then uploading the code to the NodeMCU WiFi module.
